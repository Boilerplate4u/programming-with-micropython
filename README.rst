Programming With MicroPython
============================

Code samples from the O'Reilly book.

Each directory contains code examples and scripts from the referenced
chapters. Code samples use the device name and a small description to identify
them.

These scripts work as of 12th September 2017. MicroPython is a fast moving
target and if you get errors it's probably because the API has moved on since
the book was published. Don't worry! This is a fun challenge for you to
learn something by correcting the script.

Another reason things may not work is because of hardware failure.

Most importantly, have fun..!

Best wishes,

Nicholas.
